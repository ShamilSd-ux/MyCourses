Day 1-3: Initial Setup and Planning
9:00 - 9:30 PM: Outline the detailed requirements for TeleAmeerLive:
- Define core features and functions.
- Plan the architecture (e.g., backend with FastAPI, database setup, frontend tech).

9:30 - 11:00 PM: Set up your development environment:
- Install required tools and libraries (Python, FastAPI, frontend frameworks, etc.).
- Create a basic project structure (e.g., directories for backend, frontend, config).

Day 4-10: Backend Development with FastAPI
9:00 - 10:00 PM: Code core backend features:
- Create main API routes (e.g., endpoints for receiving and forwarding messages).
- Implement data models with Pydantic.

10:00 - 11:00 PM: Add data validation and asynchronous handling:
- Ensure endpoints handle requests concurrently.
- Test endpoints using FastAPI's interactive documentation.

Day 11-15: Database and Data Handling
9:00 - 10:00 PM: Integrate database support:
- Choose and set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
- Connect the database with FastAPI using SQLAlchemy or Tortoise-ORM.

10:00 - 11:00 PM: Implement CRUD operations:
- Create, read, update, delete data operations.
- Test database interactions through the API.

Day 16-20: Frontend Implementation
9:00 - 10:00 PM: Start building the frontend:
- Set up the chosen frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.).
- Create basic UI components (e.g., user input forms, message displays).

10:00 - 11:00 PM: Connect frontend to backend:
- Implement API calls using Axios or Fetch.
- Ensure data flows smoothly between frontend and backend.

Day 21-25: Integration and Testing
9:00 - 10:00 PM: Integrate all components:
- Connect the backend, frontend, and database.
- Test the workflow from end to end (sending and forwarding messages).

10:00 - 11:00 PM: Perform debugging and unit testing:
- Identify and fix any errors or performance issues.
- Write basic tests to validate API functionality.

Day 26-30: Finalize and Polish
9:00 - 10:00 PM: Polish the UI/UX:
- Make UI improvements and add fluid animations for better user experience.
- Test responsiveness and accessibility.

10:00 - 11:00 PM: Final testing and documentation:
- Run comprehensive tests on different parts of the app.
- Write basic documentation for your code and how to use TeleAmeerLive.
